          <p class="lead">We are working with the <a href='https://cljct.org/about-us/our-mission-and-history/'>Center for Leadership and Justice</a> to look at the diaprities in educational funding.</p>

          <p>Within the state of Connecticut there is an issue of towns being divided by race and wealth leading to discriminatory practices. An example of these practices is the inequitable funding of schools. <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp'>The School + State Finance Project</a> found that “districts with greater needs, and more students of color, tend [to] have fewer financial resources” (“Segregation & Education”). There is an inequity among the funding of schools and race within Connecticut.</p>

          <p>In our research we are specifically looking at Hartford County. We want to look closer at how the population of school-age youth residing in each town has changed over a decade. We also want to look at how the spending per student varies by school district and how it has changed over time. By looking at this data and mapping it will allow us to see if the per-student spending has changed with the migration of students.</p>

          <p>These are important questions to ask to see if the funding each student should be getting follows them as they go to different school districts. If that funding isn’t moving with the students then there must be more research done to see as to where that money is going and why it isn’t moving with the students.</p>

          <p>Paragraphs like this one must begin with a `p` tag and end with a `p` closing tag.</p>

          <p>Links must begin and end with `a` anchor tags, with the web address inside either single or double quotes. If you need guidance, check out this <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp'>W3Schools HTML Tutorial</a>.

          <p>When describing charts, maps, or tables that appear further below, refer to them "...as shown in Figure 1" or "...as shown in Table 1" and include those figure/table numbers in the titles or captions below.</p>

          <p>Embed each of your published visualizations as an HTML iframe code, following instructions in <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/embed.html'>Chapter 9 of HODV</a>, similar to the sample below.</p>

          <h2>Visualizations</h2>
          <p class="lead">How many school-age youth reside in each town, and how has it changed over a decade?</p>
<p> To begin to answer this question I first needed to find data on the population of age groups in each of Hartford Counties towns. I found this data on Social Explorer, a website that contains census data on all types of demographics among the US. Social Explorer provided me with data for children ages 5-17 for the years 2010, 2017, and 2020.</p>
          
          <iframe title="Percent Change of School Aged Children from 2010-2020" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-gKd38" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gKd38/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="895" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
    <p> The first chart is a split bar graph representing the percent changes in population of children ages 5-17 in Hartford County over a decade. This chart uses percent change accounts for the differing population size of each town and allows one to normalize that data to make it comparable to each town. It can be calculated using the formula: (New value - Old value) / Old value. When you get a negative percent change then the population decreases, and if it is positive then there was an increase in population. Over a decade, from the years 2010 to 2020, all but two towns, East Granbury and New Britain, had an overall increase in population size while the rest had a decrease in population.</p>
          
          <iframe title="Percent Change of Student Population ages 5-17 from 2017-2020" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-7jtZP" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7jtZP/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="694" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
          <p> The first map is a choropleth map representing the percent change in population of children's ages 5-17 in Hartford County from 2017-2020. It uses a divergent color palette so when looking at this map the blue represents a positive percent change or an increase in population. The red represents a negative percent change or a decrease in population. The white neutral color means that the town had close to zero percent change in population. By looking at this map I could say that Bloomfield had the greatest increase in school age children because it is the darkest blue on the scale while Granby had the greatest decrease in population because it's the darkest red. Towns like Suffield, South Windsor, and Vernon are white neutral tone meaning they had very small percent change, or a little change in population. In the live link to this map you can hover over each town and see the population for the years 2010, 2017, and 2020. While hovering you can also find the percent change from 2010-2020 and from 2017-2020.</p>

          <h2>How I did it</h2>
          <p> In creating this chart and map representing the changes in school aged children I used the website Social Explorer. I used it to find their American Community Survey (ACS) 5 year estimates for 2010, 2017, and 2020 (most recent year) to find the population of all ages of Connecticut's Subdivisions. When the data comes out of the website it has all the towns in Connecticut and age ranges of “5 and under” all the way to “85 and over” so I cleaned up the data in a Google Sheet to select the towns in Hartford County and the age ranges 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 17. I then calculated the total population of 5 to 17 year olds for each year I was observing. I then normalized the data using the percent change formula in order to compare the populations of 2010 to 2020 and 2017 to 2020. I then used the website Datawrapper to create the split bar graph by pasting in the towns and corresponding percent changes of 2010 and 2020. To create the choropleth map I first used a website called Mapshapper to select the towns in Hartford County and create a geojson file that I could drop into Datawrapper to show a map of only Harford County. I then used the percent change data comparing 2017 to 2020 to create the choropleth map. In the map I choose to compare 2017 to 2020 in an attempt to be able to make comparisons to the Per Pupil Expenditure choropleth map to see if the migration of student students is followed by the increase of student spending. As a caution people should keep in mind that this map uses data from the American Community Survey 5 year estimates meaning there is an “uncertainty associated with them as a result of being based on a sample of the population rather than the full population” (Understanding and Using). Furthermore, the most recent data for 2020 was during the COVID-19 Pandemic which led to the inability to collect data from certain areas and populations causing the data to not be fully representative of the US population (Our Commitment).</p>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>
